<h2>7.3.1. Definition of charge-exchange coefficients<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-charge-exchange-coefficients" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The charge exchange reaction between an ion <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^{(\alpha +1)+}\)</span> and a
donor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H^0\)</span> (can be in this section deuterium, tritium, hydrogen or helium) is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[H^0(m) + Z^{(\alpha +1)+} \longrightarrow H^+ + Z^{* \alpha+}(n, l, j) \longrightarrow H^+ + Z^{\alpha+} + h\nu_1 + h\nu_2 + ...\]</div>
<p>Where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^{(\alpha +1)+}\)</span> is the ion capturing the donor electron into a
specific shell (n,l,j). The excited ions, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^{* \alpha+}(n, l, j)\)</span>, decay
in one or more steps to their ground state under photon emission. It is
possible for the ion <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^{(\alpha +1)+}\)</span> to capture a donor electron from
the ground-state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H^0(m=1)\)</span> but also from high-lying shells if the
electron donor is not ground-state but excited <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H^0(m=2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>A charge-exchange line observed from an ion <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^{\alpha+}\)</span> will be the
result of individual primary capture of donor electron onto specific shell of
the ion <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^{(\alpha +1)+}\)</span> which then will undergo a redistribution
process and cascade process affecting the excited populations of the recombined
ion <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^{* \alpha+}\)</span> in a thermal plasma. The quantity linking the
fundamental cross-sections and the charge-exchange observations is the
effective emission coefficient. The effective emission coefficient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}, H^0(m)}_{n\rightarrow n'}\)</span>
for a particular charge-exchange line (such as CVI <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=8\rightarrow n'=7\)</span>)
incorporate these effects. The coefficient is defined such that the number of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\rightarrow n'\)</span> photons emitted per unit volume per second per
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\pi\)</span> steradian is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}, H^0(m)}_{n\rightarrow n'}.n_{Z^{(\alpha +1)+}}.n_{H^0(m)}\)</span>
with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_{Z^{(\alpha +1)+}}\)</span> the number density of impurity receiver ions
of charge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha+1\)</span> in the plasma and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_{H^0(m)}\)</span> the number
density of beam donor atoms in the state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span>. For example for D(n=2)
donors, m=2 and for the ground state D(n=1), m=1. The methods used to calculate
the effective emission coefficients, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}, H^0(m)}_{n\rightarrow n'}\)</span>
is calculated in a collisional-radiative nl-resolved l-mixing model of all the
excited populations of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha+1\)</span> times ionized receiver ion. The
effective coefficients depend on the collision energy with the neutral beam
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_c\)</span>, plasma electron and ion temperatures, plasma impurity ion species
mix and number densities and electron density. The strongest dependences are on
collisional energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_c\)</span> and ion density <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_I\)</span>. (For more specific
use of ADAS effective charge-exchange coefficient look at CHERAB atomic data
note). For a mixed impurity plasma of known fractions with charge neutrality,
the electron and ion densities are related and it is usual to use the electron
density as a parameter.</p>
<p>The composite charge-exchange emission coefficient with both <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H^0(m=1)\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H^0(m=2)\)</span> beam donors is defined as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}}_{n\rightarrow n'} &amp;= \frac{n_{H^0(1)} q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}, H^0(1)}_{n\rightarrow n'} + n_{H^0(2)}.q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}, H^0(2)}_{n\rightarrow n'}}{n_{H^0(1)} + n_{H^0(2)}} \\
                                          &amp;= \frac{q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}, H^0(1)}_{n\rightarrow n'} + bmp(2).q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}, H^0(2)}_{n\rightarrow n'}}{1 + bmp(2)} \quad \text{with} \quad bmp(m) = \frac{n_{H^0(m)}}{n_{H^0(1)}}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Or in a more general way:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}}_{n\rightarrow n'} = \frac{q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}, H^0(1)}_{n\rightarrow n'} + \sum_{m=2}^M bmp(m).q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}, H^0(m)}_{n\rightarrow n'}}{1 + \sum_{m=2}^M bmp(m)}\]</div>
<p>The ratio of population between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_{H^0(m)}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_{H^0(1)}\)</span> is
called <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(bmp(m)\)</span>. The calculation of the donor population requires a
detailed collisional-radiative model including many ion and electron
collisional processes. For information, the fraction of excited beam atoms
depends not only on the beam energy but also on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z_{eff}\)</span>, plasma
temperature and densities. Note that D(n=1) donor dominates at high beam energy
and the small fraction of D(n=2) donor dominates at low beam energy
[Hoekstra1998]. For more practical information, look at the CHERAB atomic data
note.</p>

<p>As already mentioned above the number of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\rightarrow n'\)</span> photons
emitted per unit volume per second per <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\pi\)</span> steradian can be calculated

associated and a natural line width <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\lambda_n\)</span>. It can be calculated
that this width is small and can be neglected. The spectral line intensity as
a function of wavelength is then given by:</p>

with a Doppler shift <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\lambda_D = \lambda_n \frac{\vec{u}.\vec{l}}{c}\)</span>
with c the speed of light.</p>

<h2>7.3.3. In more details charge-exchange cross-section<a class="headerlink" href="#in-more-details-charge-exchange-cross-section" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Primary charge-exchange cross-section plays a principal role in this calculation,
since final derived impurity ion densities depend absolutely on their reliability.
Theoretical charge-exchange calculations especially for capture to the highly
excited levels of interest here show variation from one to another. Firstly,
the total charge exchange capture cross-section, that is summed over all levels,
is the most reliable quantity [Boileau89]. Very few experimental measurements
exist even of charge-exchange capture cross-section summed over all levels.
One such measurement was made with [Phaneuf82, Isler94], where a collimating
beam of multiply charge ions of charge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha+1\)</span> through a calibrated
atomic hydrogen gas target and detecting scattered product ions of charge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>
separately from the primary ions of charge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha+1\)</span>.</p>
<p>When charged ions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^{(\alpha +1)+}\)</span> are thrown against an atomic hydrogen
gas, the cross-section <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma^{CX}_{Z^{(\alpha+1)+}}\)</span> is a hypothetical
area measure around the target particle of atoms that represents a surface. If
an ion crosses this surface, there will be some kind of interaction. In the
charge-exchange reaction, the cross-section is specific to a donor electron in
the level <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H^0(m)\)</span> and capture in the shell (n,l) of the ion <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^{(\alpha+1)+}\)</span>
(abandoning j for now), hence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma^{CX}_{Z^{(\alpha +1)+}}(m,n,l)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In general, the rate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> at which a specific reaction occurs is a physical
quantity measuring the number of reactions per unit of time which can be written
as follow:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q = N.J.\sigma\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> the number of target particles, illuminated by the beam containing
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> particles per unit volume (number density of particles) travelling with
the average velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> in the rest frame of the target and these two
quantities combine in the particle current density of the beam <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(J=n.v\)</span>.
So the rate can be rewritten as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q = N.n.v.\sigma\]</div>
<p>Now, we want to get back to the specific equation for the charge-exchange rate.
For our charge-exchange reaction, the target ions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^{(\alpha+1)+}\)</span> have
a certain distribution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{Z^{(\alpha+1)+}(n,l)}(\vec{x}, \vec{u}, t)\)</span>
that needs to be taken into account in the calculation:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}(n,l), H^0(m)}_{n\rightarrow n'}(E_c) =
n_{H^0(m)}.n_{Z^{(\alpha +1)+}}(n,l).\int_{\vec{u}}f_{Z^{(\alpha+1)+}(n,l)}(\vec{u}-\vec{v_B})
.\|\vec{u}-\vec{v_B}\|.\sigma^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}(n,l), H^0(m)}_{n\rightarrow n'}(\|\vec{u}-\vec{v_B}\|).d\vec{u}\]</div>
<p>With the collision velocity between the impurity ion and the neutral atom <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_c = \|\vec{u}-\vec{v_B}\|\)</span></p>
<p>The above equation point out that the charge-exchange rate coefficient needs the
distribution of the impurity. The general case is that a Maxwellian distribution
function can be assumed in the velocity space, but there are cases such as for
the He-ash where a Maxwellian distribution does not apply and a more general
calculation of the charge-exchange rate would be needed and a new effective
emission coefficients would be needed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}(n,l), H^0(m)}_{n\rightarrow n', \text{non Max}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As a result there are possibly three different calculations for the effective
charge-exchange emission coefficient, of which only two are used in practise.</p>
<p><strong>Two different composite charge exchange emission coefficients:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A Maxwellian distribution function in velocity space is assumed for the ion <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^{(\alpha+1)+}\)</span>:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}(n,l), H^0(m)}_{n\rightarrow n'}\)</span></li>
<li>A Maxwellian distribution function in velocity space is not assumed for the ion <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^{(\alpha+1)+}\)</span>:
this requires a new set of effective charge-exchange emission coefficient
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}(n,l), H^0(m)}_{n\rightarrow n', \text{non Max}}\)</span>,
additional parameters in respect to 1. will be needed.</li>

<p>A statistical view of excited ion level populations is appropriate, the number
densities of ions in various excited levels being determined by the balance of
populating and depopulating reaction rates. Levels of principal quantum number
substantially larger than the upper levels of the observed emitted transitions
are included to allow for cascade contributions. The upper limit is determined
properly by collisional ionisation but in practise is mostly influenced by the
decay with n of the primary capture processes. The main effect of the particle
collisions and magnetic fields is to cause transitions between levels of the
same principal quantum number and so these alone are included in the calculations.
For ions in high orbital angular momentum states l, induced transitions between
whole l state populations are of most importance. Whereas, at low l, the
transitions between separate j sublevels are important. For these reasons two
populations models are used, namely:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><strong>the nl picture:</strong> in which the populations of nl levels are calculated and
the populations of j sublevels are assumed to be in proportion to their statistical weights.</li>
<li><strong>the nlj picture:</strong> in which the populations of j sublevels are calculated
in full magnetic field effects are included only in the nlj picture.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Two different composite charge exchange emission coefficients depending on the model chosen for the excited population model:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>nl picture: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}(n,l), H^0(m)}_{n\rightarrow n'}\)</span></li>
<li>nlj picture: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q^{CX, Z^{(\alpha+1)+}(n,l), H^0(m)}_{n\rightarrow n'}(\vec{B})\)</span>
these coefficients exist in ADAS but are mostly not used.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Justification of assumption usually made on the excited population calculation:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Electron impact ionisation:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Collisional transitions between nearly degenerate levels play a significant
role for the densities, ions and principal quantum shells of concern in
JET studies of charge exchange by visible spectroscopy. The transitions
are of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(nl\rightarrow nl\pm 1\)</span> in the nl picture and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(nlj\rightarrow nl\pm 1, j\pm 1\)</span> in the nlj picture and are induced
by both electron and positive ion impact. As the transition energies
approach zero, ions become relatively more efficient than electrons in
causing transitions. Detailed expressions for collisions rate coefficients
are given in Spence[1986] are are adopted here. For greatest precision,
rate coefficients for the different positive ions present in the plasma
should be combined, weighted by their fractional number densities. Since
the cross-section is essentially proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z^2_{\mu}\)</span> where
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z_{\mu}\)</span> is the impacting ion charge number, an error less than
the intrinsic uncertainty in the cross-sections is introduced by considering
a single ion species to be present of charge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z_{eff}\)</span> (the usually
defined plasma effective ion charge). The rate expressions depend sensitively
on the transition energies and so the latter must be evaluated quite precisely.
Rates are calculated in the nlj picture initially. Since at high l, where
the nl picture is often most useful, the transitions have line strengths
which tend to zero, it is suitable to sum and average over final and initial
j states to obtain rate coefficients in the nl picture. It is usual to
estimate approximately the levels at which mixing by magnetic fields matter
by a simple consideration of static energy level shifts. This is not appropriate
for a population treatment in which a detailed balance of rates is followed
to obtain actual ion populations in cases where any process may not be
fully dominant. It is evident that the field processes matter most for
low l un vuv and xuv measurements and then the nlj picture is appropriate.</p>
<p>There is a critical plasma density at which a given transition is fully
mixed: this is usually a problem for the edge densities of plasmas.</p>
<p>The sigma component are dominant for observation angles perpendicular to
the magnetic field, while the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi\)</span>-component dominates in the case
of observation angles perpendicular to the magnetic field. In summary,
in the standard analysis of the CXRS measurements on AUG the corrections
due to the CX cross-section and gyro-motion effects are not taken into
account as they are found to be small, while the corrections due to the
Zeeman effects are included.</p>
<p>Practically, the l-mixing and Zeeman effect correspond to a broadening
of the charge-exchange line that is independent of ion temperature. Due
to the fine structure each allowed transition has a slightly different
wavelength, and the total emission spectrum consists of a set of lines
instead of one line.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Collisional l-mixing:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Which of the l-levels ae populated in a charge-exchange reactions depends
on the beam energy. If the lifetime <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> of the excited states is considerably
larger than the ion-ion collision time, collisions will cause a transfer
between the different l-states of n=8 shell before the charge-exchange
electron drops to a lower level and emits a photon. This phenomenon is
called collisional l-mixing. It means that even if the population of the
l-levels would not be statistic, collisional l-mixing would make sure that
the l-levels are statistically populated. The spectrum of these lies can
be calculated in ADAS. In the case of the C6+ CXRS lines, the line broadening
would correspond to a Doppler broadening of 4eV.</div></blockquote>
<p>Zeeman splitting:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Without a magnetic field the energy levels within the same n shell differ
slightly due to the fine-structure. The presence of a magnetic field will
cause Zeeman splitting of one j-level into 2J+1 energy levels separated.
This is a stronger effect than the collisional l-mixing. For the carbon
lines, this correspond to a Doppler broadening of 90eV.</div></blockquote>
<p>The total CX spectrum, where non-thermal broadening due to l-mixing and Zeeman
splitting is included, is the sum of the Doppler spectra for every emission
line, where the relative intensity of every transition and the population of
every sublevel is taken into account. When we treat every emission line separately
the analysis of a CX spectrum gets quite complicated. Therefore the total profile
of all transition lines is presented as a single, but broadened Gaussian, of
which the peak position depends on the l-mixing and Zeeman splitting. This
Gaussian replace the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta\)</span>-function in equation.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Assumption: at the moment the collisional l-mixing and Zeeman splitting is not taken into account</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>It can however be easily done.</div></blockquote>
