<div class="section" id="rationale">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.1. </span>Rationale<a class="headerlink" href="#rationale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The governance model is a document that clearly describes how third parties are
to engage with the Cherab project and provides the rules and boundaries that
ensure that the project remains manageable within the resources available. In
this next phase of the Cherab project it makes sense to use an open community
led management model, such as the Meritocracy model used by Mozilla, Apache and
other large open source projects.</p>
<p>A key reason for setting up an open governance model is to prevent the code
from being forked. Forking, or taking the source code and setting up a competing
project, is an issue open source projects must be prepared to deal with. If
there is disagreement within the community, forking may seem to be the most
efficient solution in the early stages of a project. However, this will over
time create significant maintenance problems for everyone. There are a number
of examples in the fusion community where forking has led to code duplication
and a more costly programme.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.2. </span>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cherab is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project. Anyone with an
interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design
and participate in the decision making process. This document describes how that
participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the Cherab
community. This governance model is based on the Open Meritocracy model used by
a number of large open source software projects (e.g. Apache foundation).</p>
<p>Most users will be members of the scientific community, contributing to physics
models and diagnostic designs. The scientific strategy for Cherab will be set
through the existing management channels, such as the JET Task Force and
EUROfusion meetings. The bulk of this document deals with the technical
management of the project, to ensure the integrity of the code base is
protected and maintained at a high standard. This will be achieved through the
use of a Technical Management Committee.</p>

<div class="section" id="users">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.1. </span>Users<a class="headerlink" href="#users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Users are community members who have a need for the project. Anyone can be a
user; there are no special requirements.</p>
<p>User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying
the needs of those users. Common user contributions include (but are not
limited to):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>using the project for physics analysis</p></li>
<li><p>evangelising about the project</p></li>
<li><p>informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contributors">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.2. </span>Contributors<a class="headerlink" href="#contributors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the
project. Anyone can become a contributor. In addition to their actions as users,
contributors may also find themselves doing one or more of the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>adding new physics models and features</p></li>
<li><p>supporting new users</p></li>
<li><p>reporting bugs</p></li>
<li><p>identifying requirements</p></li>
<li><p>providing graphics and web design</p></li>
<li><p>programming</p></li>
<li><p>assisting with project infrastructure</p></li>
<li><p>writing documentation</p></li>
<li><p>fixing bugs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Contributors engage with the project through the issue tracker and mailing
list, or by writing or editing documentation. They submit changes to the
project itself via patches, which will be considered for inclusion in the
project by existing committers (see next section).</p>
<p>As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, they may
find themselves being nominated for committership.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="committers">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.3. </span>Committers<a class="headerlink" href="#committers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Committers are community members who have shown that they are committed to the
continued development of the project through ongoing engagement with the
community. Committership allows contributors to more easily carry on with
their project related activities by giving them direct access to the project’s
resources. That is, they can make changes directly to project outputs, without
having to submit changes via patches.</p>
<p>The key difference between a committer and a contributor is when this approval
is sought from the community. A committer seeks approval after the contribution
is made, rather than before. Seeking approval after making a contribution is
known as a commit-then-review process. It is more efficient to allow trusted
people to make direct contributions, as the majority of those contributions
will be accepted by the project. The project employs various communication
mechanisms to ensure that all contributions are reviewed by the community
as a whole.</p>
<p>New committers can be nominated by any existing committer. Once they have been
nominated, there will be a vote by the Technical Management Committee (TMC;
see below) to approve their membership.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technical-management-committee-tmc">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.4. </span>Technical Management Committee (TMC)<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-management-committee-tmc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The TMC is the technical decision making body and acts as stewards of the
project. The main role of the TMC members is to review code contributions and
participate in technical strategic planning. It also makes decisions when
community consensus cannot be reached.</p>
<p>Membership of the TMC is by invitation from the existing TMC members. A
nomination will result in a vote by the existing TMC members, requiring
consensus approval.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tmc-chair">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.5. </span>TMC Chair<a class="headerlink" href="#tmc-chair" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The TMC Chair is a single individual, voted for by the TMC members. Once
someone has been appointed Chair, they remain in that role until they choose to
retire, or the TMC casts a two-thirds majority vote to remove them. The TMC
Chair has no additional authority over other members of the TMC: the role is
one of coordinator and facilitator. The Chair is also expected to ensure that
all governance processes are adhered to, and has the casting vote when the
project fails to reach consensus.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="decision-making-process">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.4. </span>Decision making process<a class="headerlink" href="#decision-making-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all
members of the community. In order to ensure that the project is not bogged
down by endless discussion and continual voting, the project operates a policy
of lazy consensus. This allows the majority of decisions to be made without
resorting to a formal vote.</p>
<div class="section" id="lazy-consensus">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.4.1. </span>Lazy consensus<a class="headerlink" href="#lazy-consensus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Decision making typically involves the following steps:
- Proposal
- Discussion
- Vote (if consensus is not reached through discussion)
- Decision</p>
<p>Any community member can make a proposal for consideration by the community. In
order to initiate a discussion about a new idea for a physics model or
diagnostic they should raise their idea through the usual scientific channels
(e.g. EUROfusion task force meetings). They can then submit a patch
implementing the idea to the issue tracker (or version-control system if they
have commit access). This will prompt a review and, if necessary, a discussion
of the idea. The goal of this review and discussion is to gain approval for the
contribution. Since most people in the project community have a shared vision,
there is often little need for discussion in order to reach consensus.</p>
<p>In general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or patch, it is
recognised as having the support of the community. This is called lazy
consensus - that is, those who have not stated their opinion explicitly have
implicitly agreed to the implementation of the proposal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voting">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.4.2. </span>Voting<a class="headerlink" href="#voting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Not all decisions can be made using lazy consensus. Issues such as those
affecting the core architecture of the project must gain explicit approval in
the form of a vote. Every member of the community is encouraged to express
their opinions in all discussion and all votes. However, only TMC members have
binding votes for the purposes of technical decision making.</p>
